# CS50P
CS50P is a very popular couse on edX to understand the basic of python programming and programming in general. The course has a very rich material 
and an amazing instructor. This repo here includes all the inference including notes and code that I have got from the 2022 version of the course. 
Feel free to take a peak in to the individual folder and notes contained. 

This is purely for my own reference though and is not to be used/copied in assignments.
