Loops :- 

the ability of a program to do something again and again. 

The "while" Keyword:
====================

This is one of the wat we can express our loop and this will basically provide some condition or a question and execute whatever is inside of it it the condition 
specified is True or False as per the user defined vocabulary.

Question or condition is generally the one where the answer is usually true or false. 

Be carefull of infinte loop !! 

initilization before condition in "while" is important otherwise variable not declared error is thrown out by python.. 

Take care while using != and ++, look at the variable declaration before expressing the condition. 

The "for" Keyword:
================

We don't put conditions in for loop.

List datatype
=============

Way of containing multiple values all in the same space. Items in the list can be any python object. They do not have to be at the same type.

The "range" Keyword:
====================

Returns a range of value. Basically a list from the number specified. 

The "_" Keyword:
================

if we need a variable just because the program requires it but the human does not need it. We can use "_" character to use the same loop

"\n" -- escape sequence.

Whenever we want to get a user input that matches certain expectation we immediately say "while True"

and then use "break" when that particular condition has been met

Use return either inside the loop or mention explicitely outside on the loop

To access the items inside a list or index into a list we use numbers inside the "[]" to extract the object present inside the list

we dont need to initialize the variable using for 

The "len" Keyword:
==================

As the name suggest this basically gives us the length of the list or array and many things

The "dict" datatype:
====================

Allows us to associate one value with another, key-value pairs. 

by definition 
when we iterate over a dict we get the keys of the dict and then we can use these keys to find the pair value. 

The "None" Keyword:
==================

This is used for explicitely specifying the the information entered is unknown.



Creating abstraction of functions
==================================

This means the function does not exist yet but we are still declaring the function to get the idea what the function is actually going to do. 


Changing the internals of the function without changing the function name or function params no one can notice a change


print() all by itself is the automatic new line.


Nesting Loops
=============

One loop inside of another loop
