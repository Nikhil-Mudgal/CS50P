Key operators in python:_

>  : greater than 
>= : greater than equal to
<  : less than 
<= : less than equal to 
== : equal to
!= : not equal to

The "if" keyword :
=================

if num1 < num2: # boolean expression 

indentation is the key in python and this tells python that something inside the condition is only executed when condition suffices. We go through all the if's 
regarless we obtained 1 if or 2 if's or n if's. 

elif is a better way for comparison.

The "elif" keyword:
===================

same as multiple if's but not similar. if we get back a correct answer we directly go to program stop and we dont have to go over all the questions. 

see flow charts at 12:53 in the video.

This makes the condition mutually exclusive. 

The "else" keyword:
===================

if the "if" conditional is true and there is only one other answer left than else can be used.

These 3 conditionals are basically used for code optimization rather than anything else.

Using different conditionals we can decrease the complexity of the program and we are less likely to make mistakes and the coder is more likely to understand the code.

The "or" Keyword:
=================

can be clubbed with if.

The "and" Keyword:
==================

Conjuction of 1 or more conditions in the same if statement 

Python can return boolean also.

Pythonic Way:
=============

return True if n % 2 ==0 else False 
 
but since n % 2 == 0 already returns True or False why even use if and else:

just use :

return n % 2 == 0


The "match" keyword:
====================

Multiple conditions compactly

case _ as the last "else" like statement
